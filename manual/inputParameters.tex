In this section we describe all the parameters which can be included in the input namelist. 

\section{General parameters}

\param{symmetry\_option}

{1}
{Always}
{Determines whether stellarator symmetry is imposed.\\

\section{Resolution parameters}

For any new set of surface geometries you consider, you should vary the resolution parameters in this section to make sure
they are large enough.  These parameters should be large enough that the code results you care about are unchanged under further
resolution increases. (A possible exception is \parlink{ns\_magnetization}, which you may want to set to 1 to make the magnetization
uniform in the $s$ direction.)

Since the original \vmec~angle is chosen to minimize the number of Fourier modes required,
more modes are required in any other coordinate.

{{\ttfamily "uniform"}}
{Always}
{Determines how the thickness $d$ of the magnetization layer is computed.\\

{\ttfamily d\_option} = {\ttfamily uniform}: The magnetization layer will have a uniform thickness set by \parlink{d\_initial}. As a result, the

\section{Parameters determining the normal magnetic field on the plasma surface}

There are three ways to specify $B_{normal}$: (1) by assuming the existence of TF coils that create a purely toroidal axisymmetric field
(set \parlink{include\_Bnormal\_from\_TF} = {\ttfamily .true.}), (2) by loading data from a bnorm file (set \parlink{load\_bnorm}={\ttfamily .true.}), or

{If true, the contribution to $B_{normal}$ from a perfectly axisymmetric field $\vect{B} = \vect{e}_{\zeta} \mu_0 G /(2\pi R)$
will be added to the total $B_{normal}$. The net poloidal current $G$ for this field is determined by \parlink{net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes}
(if it is set to a nonzero value) or by the value corresponding to the vmec file \parlink{wout\_filename}.}

\myhrule

\param{net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes}
{real}
{0.0}
{If \parlink{include\_Bnormal\_from\_TF}={\ttfamily .true.}}
{Net poloidal current $G$ linking the plasma poloidally. If this value is 0.0 and a VMEC wout file is used to determine the plasma surface shape,
then $G$ will be determined by the value corresponding to that VMEC configuration. If {\ttfamily net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes} is nonzero,
this value will override the value from the VMEC configuration. This provides a method to scale the magnitude of $B$ for a VMEC configuration.}
